\title{Calculate Standard Error of Measurement (SEM) and its Confidence Interval}
\usage{
calc_sem(sd, rel = 0.85, ci = 95)
}
\arguments{
\item{sd}{Standard deviation of the normative mean score.}

\item{rel}{Reliability of the measurement (must be between 0 and 1). (Default is 0.85).}

\item{ci}{Confidence interval percentage (default is 95).}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
        - `sem`: Standard Error of Measurement
        - `ci_sem`: Confidence interval for SEM
}
\description{
This function calculates the Standard Error of Measurement (SEM) and its confidence interval.
It is designed for psychometric calculations involving reliability and standard deviation.
}
\examples{
# Example with standard deviation and reliability
calc_sem(sd = 10, rel = 0.9, ci = 80)
# Example with z-score parameters (sd = 1)
calc_sem(sd = 1, rel = 0.85, ci = 95)
