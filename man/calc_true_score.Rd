\title{Calculate True Score Estimate}
\usage{
calc_true_score(score, m, rel = 0.85)
}
\arguments{
\item{score}{Observed score.}

\item{m}{Normative mean score.}

\item{rel}{Reliability of the measurement (must be between 0 and 1; default is 0.85).}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the true score estimate.
}
\description{
This function calculates the true score estimate using the observed score,
reliability of the measurement, and the normative mean. The estimate is based on the assumption of the regression towards the mean.
The true score is estimated using the formula: true_score = rel x score + (1 - rel) x m.
}
\examples{
# Example with observed score, normative mean, and reliability
calculate_true_score(score = 80, m = 70, rel = 0.85)
# Example with z-score (m = 0)
calculate_true_score(score = 0.8, m = 0, rel = 0.85)
