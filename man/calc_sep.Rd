\title{Calculate Standard Error of Prediction (SEP) and its Confidence Interval}
\usage{
calc_sep(sd, rel = 0.85, ci = 95)
}
\arguments{
\item{sd}{Standard deviation of the normative mean score.}

\item{rel}{Reliability of the measurement (must be between 0 and 1). Default is 0.85.}

\item{ci}{Confidence interval percentage. Default is 95.}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
        - `sep`: Standard Error of Prediction
        - `sep_ci`: Confidence interval for SEP
}
\description{
This function calculates the Standard Error of Prediction (SEP) and its confidence interval,
based on Formula 3.8.5 from Lord and Novick (1968).
It is designed for Reliable Change Index (RCI) calculations involving two measurements
obtained from the same test, as proposed by Lord and Novick (1968).

\examples{
# Example with standard deviation and reliability
calc_sep(sd = 10, rel = 0.9, ci = 80)
# Example with z-score parameters (sd = 1)
calc_sep(sd = 1, rel = 0.85, ci = 95)
