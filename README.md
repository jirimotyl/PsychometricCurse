# PsychometricCurse

## Why is it called a "curse"?

Wikipedia defines a **curse** as:
> *Aany expressed wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall or attach to one or more persons, a place, or an object. In particular, "curse" may refer to such a wish or pronouncement made effective by a supernatural or spiritual power, such as a god or gods, a spirit, or a natural force, or else as a kind of spell by magic (usually black magic or dark magic) or witchcraft; in the latter sense, a curse can also be called a hex or a jinx. In many belief systems, the curse itself (or accompanying ritual) is considered to have some causative force in the result. To reverse or eliminate a curse is sometimes called "removal" or "breaking", as the spell has to be dispelled, and often requires elaborate rituals or prayers.*

In the world of psychological assessment, the term "curse" takes on a metaphorical meaning, one that reflects the profound and sometimes irreversible impact of diagnostic labels and test interpretations. As Efran, Lukens, and Lukens (1990, p. 89) wrote:
> "We were on the phone with a gentleman who wanted to know if we treated **'borderlines'**—his wife was one, and they both had problems. We tried to indicate that we didn’t treat borderlines, we treated **people**, some of whom might have been given that label."

This package is named **PsychometricCurse** to serve as a permanent reminder: **Diagnoses, like curses, can stick.** They shape how people see themselves and how others see them, often long after the assessment is over. The power to apply such labels is not to be taken lightly.

### What This Package Offers
This package provides tools that are still underused in everyday practice, including:
- Automatic calculation of confidence intervals around scores,
- Accounting for reliability of methods,
- Interpretation of measurement error,
- More precise evaluation of performance changes over time.

The goal is to promote **replicable, evidence-based clinical reasoning**, to help clinicians move beyond intuition and toward data-informed decisions.

### A Word of Caution
Yet, numbers are not sacred or infallible. Performance fluctuates naturally, and even healthy individuals may produce below-average results. Clinicians must avoid two pitfalls:
- Overpathologizing minor deviations, and
- Dismissing genuine but subtle struggles.

As the quote above reminds us, **we don’t treat labels; we treat people.** Use this package as both a tool and a warning: interpret with care, question rigorously, and always remember the human behind the data.
